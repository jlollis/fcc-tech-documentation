Technical Documentation Page
===============

This is a technical documentation page, which I created as a small project for the new [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum in August 2018.

Notes
-----------
Since I just discontinued my subscription to Adobe Photoshop after the most recent price increase, I have been using [GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)](https://www.gimp.org/), 
a free and open source editor built in Python. It is very close to Photoshop, and can even be modified to be more similar to Photoshop my installing certain plugins. I took this
project as an opportunity to assemble documentation on how to more closely emulate the Photoshop experience, to make GIMP more easy to use for long-time Photoshop users, like
myself.
